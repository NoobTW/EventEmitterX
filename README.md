# EventEmitterX

There shouldn't be EventEmitter9 since there's no iPhone 9 (yet). It's time for EventEmitterX.

EventEmitterX, as great as EventEmitter3, but the better name.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save eventemitterx
```

## Usage

Take a look at [primus/eventemitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3) because EventEmitterX is just a wrapper of it.
